# Multi-factor approach to understanding a portfolio's country risk exposure

How do you assess your portfolio’s risk exposure when the entities you invest in are international, complex and face a multitude of regulatory challenges? How do you assess the risk exposure to a company that is headquartered in a relatively “safe” country, but has key subsidiaries spread across more volatile, less-known locations?

By utilizing country risk models, we can provide a new and bigger picture of your portfolio’s country risk exposure. The following article will draw on these risk factors and weigh your portfolio’s investment strategy based on key factors such as the revenue distribution and the location of the company’s headquarters to highlight your investment exposure.
